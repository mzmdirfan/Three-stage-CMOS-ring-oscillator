# Abstract
The design and simulation of a three-stage CMOS ring oscillator using the SkyWater PDK. The oscillator, consisting of three interconnected inverters, demonstrates stable oscillation characteristics, including tunable frequency and appropriate duty cycle. Simulation results highlight the impact of transistor sizing and load capacitance on performance. This work emphasizes the significance of ring oscillators in integrated circuit applications

# CMOS RING OSCILLATOR

The ring oscillator is “an odd number of inverters are connected in a series form with positive feedback & output oscillates between two voltage levels either 1 or zero to measure the speed of the process.
Ring oscillator uses an odd number of inverters to achieve more gain than a single inverting amplifier. The inverter gives a delay to the input signal and if the numbers of inverters are increases then oscillator frequency will be decreased. So the desired oscillator frequency depends on the number of inverter stages of the oscillator.”

The s frequency of oscillation formula for this oscillator is

ring-oscillator-frequency
ring-oscillator-frequency
Here T = time delay for single inverter

n = number of inverters in the oscillator
